**TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this section when creating actual file):**

This is a CONCISE quick reference derived from README.md. Follow these rules:

1. **Explain the WORKFLOW**, not just features:
   - BAD: "Hand size preservation - Disabled Jokers no longer shrink your hand"
   - GOOD: "When Crimson Heart disables a hand-size Joker, the hand size is preserved. When a non-hand-size Joker is disabled next, the bonus becomes permanent."

2. **Be SPECIFIC about conditions**:
   - BAD: "Hand size preservation when disable"
   - GOOD: "Hand size preservation only applies to Crimson Heart boss disabling hand-size Jokers"

3. **OMIT sections that don't apply**:
   - No "Controls" section if mod has no keybinds (don't write "No controls" - just omit)
   - No "Configuration" if there are no config options (or only debug logging)
   - No "Key Features" bullet list that restates the tagline

4. **Length**: Should be ~20-40 lines. If README is 80 lines, description should be ~25% of that.

5. **Focus on**: What → When → How → Edge cases
